# liri-node-app

Overview

In this assignment, we will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives back data.

Our LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

In a command line the user should type one of choices for that

   * `concert-this` -  "with the follow of artist or band name after it"

   * `spotify-this-song` -  "with the follow of song name here"

   * `movie-this` -  "with the movie name after it"

   * `do-what-it-says` - just will run 'spotify-this-song' for the song name from 'random.txt' file
